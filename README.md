# Student-Performance-Analysis
This dashboard presents a clear view of student performance by analyzing attendance, internal tests, assignments, and study hours. It highlights key trends, predicts final exam scores using machine learning, and helps identify at-risk students with actionable, data-driven insights.

📘 Student Performance Prediction – README

This project presents a complete Student Performance Analysis and Prediction System built using Python, Machine Learning, and a custom HTML-based output interface. The goal is to understand how multiple academic factors influence final exam marks and to predict student performance with high accuracy. By combining exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and a visually intuitive dashboard, the system helps educators and learners make data-driven academic decisions.

📊 Project Overview

The dashboard integrates various academic parameters such as attendance, internal test scores, assignment performance, and daily study hours. These features are analyzed using correlation studies, scatter plots, and statistical summaries to uncover the strongest predictors of final exam outcomes. The predictive model—trained using Linear Regression—achieves excellent accuracy with low MAE, low RMSE, and a high R² score, making the predictions reliable and actionable.

The HTML interface (StudentAnalysisPred.html 

StudentAnalysisPred

) renders prediction outputs, visual charts, and evaluation metrics directly in the browser. It includes highlighted code cells, styled components, and visualization elements that mirror a Jupyter Notebook environment. This makes the analysis easy to navigate while maintaining the look and feel of a data science workflow.
